# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application enables users to upload documents and automatically process them through a three-stage pipeline: OCR text extraction, document classification, and document summarization. The system provides a simple web interface for document upload and displays processing results once complete.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload
**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents through a web interface, so that I can process them through the IDP pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a user accesses the web application THE SYSTEM SHALL display a simple document upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a document file THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the file type and size
3. WHEN a user submits a valid document THE SYSTEM SHALL upload it to secure cloud storage
4. WHEN a document upload is successful THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger the IDP processing pipeline
5. WHEN a document upload fails THE SYSTEM SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: OCR Text Extraction
**User Story:** As a system, I want to extract text content from uploaded documents, so that the text can be used for further processing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a document is uploaded THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically trigger OCR processing
2. WHEN OCR processing begins THE SYSTEM SHALL extract text content from the document
3. WHEN OCR processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store the extracted text in JSON format
4. WHEN OCR processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and notify the user
5. WHEN OCR results are stored THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger document classification

### Requirement 3: Document Classification
**User Story:** As a system, I want to classify documents based on their content, so that documents can be categorized appropriately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN OCR processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically trigger document classification
2. WHEN classification begins THE SYSTEM SHALL analyze the extracted text content
3. WHEN classification completes THE SYSTEM SHALL determine the document category
4. WHEN classification results are ready THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in the database
5. WHEN classification is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger document summarization

### Requirement 4: Document Summarization
**User Story:** As a system, I want to generate summaries of processed documents, so that users can quickly understand document content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN document classification completes THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically trigger summarization
2. WHEN summarization begins THE SYSTEM SHALL analyze the extracted text content
3. WHEN summarization completes THE SYSTEM SHALL generate a concise summary
4. WHEN summarization results are ready THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in the database
5. WHEN all processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL update the user interface

### Requirement 5: Results Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the processing results of my uploaded documents, so that I can access the extracted information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN all IDP processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL display the results in the web interface
2. WHEN displaying results THE SYSTEM SHALL show the original document name and upload time
3. WHEN displaying results THE SYSTEM SHALL show the extracted text content
4. WHEN displaying results THE SYSTEM SHALL show the document classification
5. WHEN displaying results THE SYSTEM SHALL show the document summary
6. WHEN processing is in progress THE SYSTEM SHALL show the current processing status

### Requirement 6: Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system, I want to store processing results in a flexible database, so that results can be retrieved and displayed efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN processing results are generated THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in a NoSQL database
2. WHEN storing data THE SYSTEM SHALL use a flexible schema to accommodate different document types
3. WHEN storing data THE SYSTEM SHALL include timestamps for tracking processing stages
4. WHEN retrieving data THE SYSTEM SHALL efficiently query results for display
5. WHEN data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL ensure data persistence and reliability
